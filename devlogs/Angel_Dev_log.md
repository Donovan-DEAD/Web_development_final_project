Use of GenAI>
- Prompt: Using the html and css I already have, enhance it and modify whats missing that should be necessary, tell me all the changes you make.
- Result: The media part at the end of the css code and some changes around de css code that enhance it like using clases instead of tags.

- Prompt: Give me a pallet of color that can be used in the page, using green as the main color.
- Result: The colors that are being used on the main page.

Personal Refelction
Even tho i think css is something im not used to, i think is a different perspective of coding i may no had until now, all the tries and error that comes with making the page look good, but specially a good planification did make it easier.
