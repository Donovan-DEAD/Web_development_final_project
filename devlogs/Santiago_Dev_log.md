*DEVLOG*

##September 8 (I'm doing the devlogs of this past weekend because I forgot to do them each session)

Progress: Created a view for the blogpost template
Roadblocks: I didn't know how to style some things, I asked chatGPT for help on it.
Use of GenAI:
- Prompt: Using the following HTML and CSS code, please show how to make the page re-sizeable and the header look better.
- Result: The lines after line 107 in the blogpost.css, now I know how to dynamically re-size, although bootstrap will take care of some of that.

-Prompt (v0): Generate an SVG of an agricultural company for a favicon
-Result: The favicon we're using for the page was generated by this AI :)
