*DEVLOG*

##September 8 (I'm doing the devlogs of this past weekend because I forgot to do them each session)

Progress: Created a view for the blogpost template
Roadblocks: I didn't know how to style some things, I asked chatGPT for help on it.
Use of GenAI:
- Prompt: Using the following HTML and CSS code, please show how to make the page re-sizeable and the header look better.
- Result: The lines after line 107 in the blogpost.css, now I know how to dynamically re-size, although bootstrap will take care of some of that.

-Prompt (v0): Generate an SVG of an agricultural company for a favicon
-Result: The favicon we're using for the page was generated by this AI :)

##October 13
Progress: Adding issues into Github for tracking
Roadblocks: Time (like Alexander Hamilton), was working on other stuff

##October 18 & 19 & 20
Progress: Added the algorithm for the search bar and the dynamic blogpost creation.
Roadblocks: The project has gotten so big that it sometimes gets hard to understand where the data is flowing.
Use of GenAI:
- Prompt (Gemini 2.5 Pro): I have this Mongoose Schema for a Blogpost. Please show me how I can dynamically generate a blogpost with the blocks that are present in the blog_blocks section. Use nodejs and EJS.
- Result: Gave me a basic guide on how to connect all this and populate the database for testing. Adapted this to the architecture of our project, as the guide Gemini provided was pretty monolithic.

-Prompt (Copilot): How will the ejs template know where the data is coming from?
-Result: Quick explanation on how the template handles the views, as I was lost between the routing of all the files of our project.
